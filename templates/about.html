    <h2>What is Recommendo?</h2>
    <p>
      Recommendo is a content-based book recommendation system built with simplicity and privacy in mind. 
      It uses natural language processing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest books 
      based on your favorite titles—no accounts, no databases, just straightforward recommendations.

    <h2>Why Recommendo?</h2>
    <p>
      Many recommendation systems overcomplicate things with heavy databases, user profiles, and tracking. Recommendo 
      respects your privacy and keeps the experience focused on what matters: finding your next great read quickly and easily.

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>
      When you enter a book title, Recommendo compares its metadata — genres, descriptions, authors — against a curated dataset. 
      It then computes similarity scores and suggests the five most similar books, helping you discover titles you'll love.
